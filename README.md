### ðŸ‘‹ Howdy all, Iâ€™m Nicolas Layne!
I'm currently a senior at Prairie View A&M University about to obtain my B.S. in Computer Science (check back in with me on that in May 2022!). I love any sort of software development/engineering, but have the most experience with web development (front-end, back-end, and full-stack are all good with me!).
